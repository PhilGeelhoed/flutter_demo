# Flutter Demo App
> Here is visual flutter demo I made for a lovely company in the Netherlands. The app is in dutch and only is a visual demo of what a flutter app could look like. 
> I wanted to implement a breathing effect. That's why the background is breathing slowly with you. It is a simple app that shows a video and gives you some emotional advice

## Little Intro
This app is created to show what flutter is capable of in only a few days. This app is only for demo purposes and is not trying to be a working application. 

The main functionality is that you can insert an Emotion and that is gives you a little analysis of what you should do with the emotions. The text is total BS and should not be taking seriously.

The main purpose of this app was showing the visual aspect of flutter and how easy it is to implement animations.

There are two options for installation:
> Option 1 (for Android)

Download the demo.apk in the APK folder and install it on your phone
