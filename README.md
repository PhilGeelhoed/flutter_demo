# Flutter Demo App
> Here is visual flutter demo I made for a lovely company in the Netherlands. The app is in dutch and only is a visual demo of what a flutter app could look like. 
> I wanted to implement a breathing effect. That's why the background is breathing slowly with you. It is a simple app that shows a video and gives you some emotional advice

## Installation
There are two options for installation:
> Option 1 (for Android)
Download the demo.apk in the APK folder and install it on your phone

> Option 2
- Download the whole project
- Open it in IntelliJ or Android Studio
- Build it how you want it (if you are using an emulator, since the newest version of flutter the emolator can't play the video)

### Setup

- If you want more syntax highlighting, format your code like this:

> update and install this package first

```shell
$ brew update
$ brew install fvcproductions
```

> now install npm and bower packages

```shell
$ npm install
$ bower install
```
